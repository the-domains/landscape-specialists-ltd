Landscaping Specialists started in Edmonton in 2008 as a summer job with friends doing landscape maintenance work. Then after two years of building a large client base, the encouraging reviews and referrals pushed us to expand further. Through this expansion in 2010, we were fortunate to offer our full landscaping services to larger scaled projects through home builders, developers, and commercial private owners.

Areas of our landscaping services are: Edmonton, Spruce Grove, St. Albert, Nisku, Leduc, Beaumont, and Sherwood Park.
