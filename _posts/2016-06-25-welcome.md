**WELCOME**

If you are a new home owner that requires either minimum front landscaping to meet their subdivision requirements, to full custom front and back landscaping, we have the experience to assist you from start to finish.

We are a design & build construction company in Edmonton, meaning that we not only understand the design theory and the benefits of the process, but we've built it, so we know exactly what it takes to bring your vision to life.

Landscaping Specialists started in Edmonton in 2008 as a summer job with friends doing landscape maintenance work. Then after two years of building a large client base, the encouraging reviews and referrals pushed us to expand further. Through this expansion in 2010, we were fortunate to offer our full landscaping services to larger scaled projects through home builders, developers, and commercial private owners.

Today we are operating multiple crews to fulfill our landscaping services throughout Edmonton and the surrounding areas to both residential and commercial clients.

Areas of our landscaping services are: Edmonton, Spruce Grove, St. Albert, Nisku, Leduc, Beaumont, and Sherwood Park.
